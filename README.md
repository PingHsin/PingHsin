## ✨ About Me
I’m a self-taught engineer who stumbled into programming after graduating. My journey began while I was working as a Chinese teacher for 12-year-old kids in the USA. When the coding teacher unexpectedly left, I stepped in to fill the gap. To my surprise, I discovered a genuine passion for coding and found great joy in sharing that knowledge with the kids. This experience ignited my journey in programming.

Initially, I focused on frontend development, but I eventually transitioned to backend and application work. During my time in the UK, I explored cryptocurrency development. Now, I’m settled in Seattle, where I’m honing my skills in infrastructure backend work!
